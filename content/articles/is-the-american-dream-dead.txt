Essentially, the concept of the "American Dream" is that anyone can achieve economic success if they work hard enough. This concept originates from the principles of  "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" stated in the Declaration of Independence, but wasn't popularized until the 20th Century, when James Truslow Adams redefined it as "a dream" where life is "better and richer for everyone."

Few ideas in American cultural history have proven to be more enduring and more powerful than the American Dream. Initially described by historian James Truslow Adams as a dream of life "better, richer, and fuller" for all, the idea rested not simply on material prosperity, but on communal belief in social mobility and opportunity. Generations have been stirred by that promise in the form of a ray of hope, motivating citizens as well as immigrants in the belief that perseverance and hard work somehow would yield a better day to come. Yet, in present time, there has grown a vast disconnection. The bitter realities of stagnation in wages, continually surging costs of living, and increasing divides between poor and rich have cast a shadow of doubt over the very foundations of the Dream. No longer is the question whether the dream exists, but whether it is possible: is the American Dream dead, or has it become fantasy for the masses, left for the few privileged?
The American Dream has long been a cornerstone of U.S. culture and identity. First articulated during the Great Depression by James Truslow Adams in The Epic of America (1931), it described the belief that success and prosperity were attainable for anyone through hard work, freedom, and opportunity. Over time, this concept became embedded in major historical shifts, including post–World War II economic growth, the Civil Rights Movement, and waves of immigration, all reinforcing the pursuit of upward mobility. In the present day, however, rising inequality, mounting student debt, housing instability, and structural barriers prompt renewed debate over whether the American Dream is still achievable or must be reimagined to reflect modern realities.
In the modern era, however, the American Dream has turned into a controversial and complex idea. Economic upheavals—the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic all contributed to financial distress for the ordinary people, with skyrocketing costs of living and stagnating wages  have made the traditional markers of success increasingly elusive. The U.S. federal minimum wage enforced by the Department of Labor (as of August 2025) is stuck at $7.25 USD per hour, the same as in 2009. This has made the concept of the American Dream extremely complex and controversial as the cost of living has substantially increased since 2009. This causes the American Dream to be hard to believe, as even with hard work you can’t go that far just with $7.25, especially if you live in a major city such as New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago. Along with inflation, the minimum wage is practically nothing with normal 40 hour weeks, as the value of the dollar is extremely different from 2009, making the minimum wage almost unethical. Moreover, the American Dream is different to every single American. For some, it's owning a home; for others, it’s building a successful business or giving their children access to elite education. In this modern context, the American Dream has evolved into a complex, sometimes contested ideal—one shaped by economic realities, cultural values, and personal aspirations.
The purpose of this research is to explore the evolution of the American Dream, examining how its meaning has shifted over time and whether it continues to function as a realistic aspiration in modern America by analyzing historical context and economic data. The goal is to evaluate if the Dream is still attainable, how it differs across different American perspectives, and what it reveals about the nation’s values, opportunities, and inequalities
The American Dream embodies the belief that any individual, no matter their socioeconomic background, has the right to achieve upward mobility and success through hard work and determination by immigrating to the United States. Recall that this concept was first popularized by James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America, where he described it as a dream of a land in which life should be better and richer for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.
Following World War II, the United States experienced significant economic growth, leading to a flourishing middle class. This era saw increased homeownership, higher education enrollment, and improved retirement security. The expansion of the middle class was a testament to the realization of the American Dream for many Americans during this period. This era was the traditional American Dream you’d see all over Hollywood. Life was slow and easy, with the majority of Americans being working class. Affording a home or a car wasn’t hard, and sending your children to advanced education was the priority and extremely doable. 
In recent decades, the American Dream has been challenged by economic downturns such as the dot-com crash, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. These events led to job losses, wage stagnation, and increased financial insecurity for many individuals. Alongside inflation, affording normal everyday items such as groceries and gas for your car have been extremely difficult to afford for some people, as wages are still too low while the cost of living increases. 
Over the past 50 years, while nominal wages have increased, they have not kept pace with inflation. In 1975, the average hourly wage was approximately $3.50, and by 2025, it had risen to about $25.72. However, when adjusted for inflation, real wages have remained relatively flat, eroding purchasing power. Furthermore, the minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009, and since then the entire economy has changed. Housing prices, loans, mortgages, car prices, and education have exponentially risen. The cost of living has approximately risen 50.58% since 2009, while minimum wage has stayed the same. While the minimum wage varies state by state (like New York being $16.50 to balance out the high cost of living), it is still extremely hard to live with that money in these big cities. 
Housing affordability has become a significant issue in recent years. The rapid increase in home prices, coupled with rising mortgage rates, has made homeownership less attainable for many Americans. As of 2025, housing affordability stands at levels close to the lows seen during the Global Financial Crisis, indicating a persistent challenge for prospective homeowners. 
Access to higher education remains a critical factor in achieving the American Dream. However, disparities in educational opportunities persist, often correlating with socioeconomic status. Individuals from higher-income families typically have access to better educational resources, enhancing their prospects for success. In contrast, those from lower-income backgrounds may face challenges in accessing quality education, limiting their upward mobility. For instance, the average cost of a private university is $38,421 per year, which increases to $58,628 after adding all the expenses. Paying this substantial amount is often impossible for families that aren’t upper class, and although most of these universities offer financial aid, it does not give enough to middle class families that have other expenses to pay for. 
Public opinion on the American Dream is increasingly divided. Many individuals express frustration over stagnant wages, rising costs, housing prices, education, and limited upward mobility. Online platforms such as Reddit and TikTok feature discussions and personal stories highlighting the challenges faced by everyday Americans in achieving the American Dream. These narratives reflect a growing sentiment that the traditional path to success may no longer be as attainable as it once was.
The question of whether upward mobility remains attainable in the United States is complex. On one hand, there are still opportunities for individuals to succeed despite coming from humble beginnings. Success stories like Jan Koum, co-founder of WhatsApp, illustrate that it is possible for someone who immigrated with few resources to achieve extraordinary wealth and influence through innovation and perseverance. Similarly, numerous entrepreneurs and professionals continue to demonstrate that hard work, creativity, and strategic networking can lead to significant upward mobility.
On the other hand, structural and socioeconomic barriers often limit upward mobility for large segments of the population. People from higher-income families generally have better access to quality education, mentorship, and financial resources, which improves their academic and professional outcomes. Conversely, those from lower-income backgrounds may struggle with limited access to educational programs, extracurricular opportunities, and social networks necessary to compete on equal footing. Rising living costs, stagnant real wages, and mounting debt further complicate the path to economic advancement, especially in major metropolitan areas. While the American Dream is not entirely dead, achieving upward mobility today often requires more resources, planning, and sometimes luck than it did in previous generations. For example, in New York City there is a test called the Specialized High School Entrance Exam. People from wealthier backgrounds can afford experienced tutors to give them valuable skills to get high scores on this test. However, people from lower income backgrounds don’t have this opportunity, and oftentimes don’t do as well on these tests due to this reason. This limits people that come from lower income backgrounds from rising up in society and going to these elite “feeder” schools which makes them miss the opportunity to later go to elite universities.
The question arises: Is the American Dream dead or merely evolving? While traditional markers of success like homeownership and financial stability may be more challenging to attain, the core ideals of ambition and determination continue to resonate. The concept of the American Dream may need to adapt to contemporary realities, emphasizing resilience, adaptability, and the pursuit of personal fulfillment over traditional measures of success.
It is evident that people coming from wealthier families have an advantage when it comes to performing “better” financially in life; they have access to mentors, college professors, more resources overall, as well as parents that know how to make efficient, monetary decisions. However, coming from a wealthier family does not guarantee success, hence proving that the American Dream- working hard to achieve your dream life- may be true. While many argue that the American Dream is dead, there are numerous people who have achieved it. For instance, Jan Koum, the co-founder of WhatsApp. Koum was born in Ukraine, however he immigrated to the United States when he turned 16. Growing up, he did not have a lot of money; he and his mother relied on government assistance for a multitude of necessities like food and water. He later worked in Yahoo, formed close connections in the 1990s, and as a result, created WhatsApp. The app later on sold to Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion. His story demonstrates that despite growing up without familial advantages, working hard- the epitome of the American Dream- can pay off. Jan Konum now has a personal net worth of $17.1 billion. 
According to James Truslow Adams, who first defined the American Dream as “that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement,” the Dream itself is not merely about wealth, money, cars, or luxury items. Instead, it is about having equal opportunity to turn one’s life around and improve one’s overall quality of life.
But does pursuing a professional career, such as becoming a doctor or lawyer, guarantee that you will achieve this so-called “American Dream”? Not necessarily.
Ashley Chorath, a doctor-in-training, pointed out: “After medical school, residents are paying $200,000, $300,000 and $400,000 of student debt back on this $50,000 or $60,000 dollar salary. In addition to that, you’re working many hours, usually at least 50 to 60.” Isn’t that insane? Carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, yet earning only tens of thousands per year during residency. On top of that, the student debt doesn’t even include the cost of rent, food, or daily living expenses during those years of training.
So how does one achieve the American Dream when even those who pursue “better” or “prestigious” career paths find themselves trapped by debt and exhausting working conditions?
So, is the American Dream dead?
The American Dream has never been a static promise—it has always shifted alongside the country’s economic, cultural, and social realities. What was once symbolised by postwar stability, affordable homes, and accessible education has now become a more complex, sometimes elusive ideal, shaped by stagnant wages, soaring costs due to government policies, and even structural inequalities. For some, like Jan Koum, perseverance and innovation show that the Dream is still alive; however, for many others, systemic barriers make upward mobility far more difficult.
Ultimately, the American Dream is not dead, however it can no longer be understood purely as homeownership or financial security. Instead, it must be redefined to reflect today’s struggles and aspirations. In the modern world, the American Dream may be less about material wealth but rather self-resilience, opportunities, and the pursuit of fulfillment despite obstacles. Whether it thrives or fades will depend on how today’s society addresses inequality and ensures fair access to education, wages, and opportunities for all. Only then can the Dream return to its original purpose: a vision of a “better, richer, and fuller” life that remains within reach for everyone, not just the privileged few.
